# SHero Web App 🦸‍♂️
Project Description:
This is the frontend part of the application for managing the superhero database. The application provides an interface for creating, editing and deleting superhero profiles, as well as viewing the list and detailed information on each superhero. The site is available at the [link](https://s-hero.vercel.app/), but to start working with it, you need to wait for the backend server to start.

Follow the [link](https://superhero-backend-g2ow.onrender.com) and wait until the backend server starts working, after which the inscription "Living" will appear, then it will be correct to use the site s-hero.vercel.app.

## 📋 Main functions:
- Create a Superhero:
Allows you to add a new superhero to the database by filling in fields such as nickname, real name, origin description, superpowers, catchphrase, and adding images.
- Edit Superhero Profile:
Allows you to edit an existing superhero's details and update their images.
- Delete Superhero:
Delete a superhero profile from the database.
- Superheroes List with Pagination:
Displays a list of all superheroes with a preview (one image and nickname), with the ability to switch pages, 5 superheroes per page.
- Detailed Profile View:
View full information about a superhero, including all images and a detailed description.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- The site is built on React, providing a convenient interface for interacting with superhero data.
- State Management: The app uses Redux for state management, making it easy to organize data and flow information between app components.
- Asynchronous functions: implemented to handle requests and responses from the server, allowing you to perform CRUD operations on heroes in real time.
- Backend: implemented in Node.js using the Express.js framework.
- TypeScript: Ensuring type safety and improving code readability.
